An e-commerce website is an online platform that allows users to browse products, add items to a shopping cart, and complete purchases. 
Building this project using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is effective because it supports all major web technologies such as HTML, CSS, 
JavaScript, and backend languages like Node.js or PHP. VS Code also provides useful extensions like Live Server, Git integration, and 
code formatting tools, which make development faster and easier.

The website typically contains several pages, including a home page, product listing page, product details page,
shopping cart page, and a checkout page. HTML is used to create the structure of these pages, while CSS is applied to design
and style the layout, ensuring the site looks attractive and user-friendly. JavaScript adds functionality, such as updating
the cart, managing quantities, validating user input, and making the website interactive.

For processing data and handling users, a backend system is required. Frameworks such as Node.js with Express, PHP,
or Python with Django/Flask are commonly used to manage product data, user registration, login systems, and order processing.
The backend communicates with a database—like MySQL, MongoDB, or Firebase—to store and retrieve information such as user accounts,
product details, and purchase history.

This project helps students understand full-stack development by combining front-end design, back-end logic, and database operations.
It also teaches important concepts like responsive layout, user authentication, CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), and
session handling. With additional features like an admin panel, product categories, payment integration, and responsive design
for mobile devices, the project can be expanded into a more advanced real-world application.

Overall, developing an e-commerce website in VS Code provides a complete learning experience and a strong foundation for understanding
how modern online shopping systems work.
